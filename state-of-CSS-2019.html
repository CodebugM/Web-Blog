          <h1>Cookies</h1>
          <p>I’m a big fan of developer newsletters, especially MDN developer and the freeCodeCamp newsletters. I find that I tend to read about what’s new in the developer industry most of the time only when promoted with an unread email in my inbox. I rarely find myself simply scrolling through a developer news website (although maybe I should take that habit up one of these days), so getting an email with the news of the day (/week) distilled in an easily digestible format is what gets me reading. Which is just as well, I suppose.</p>
          <p>In the most recent MDN developer newsletter they linked to this freeCodeCamp article on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-state-of-css-2019-survey-results-are-live/">“The state of CSS 2019”</a>. The first of its kind, this State of CSS survey’s results provide us with a glimpse into the mind of developers right now, the methodologies, CSS frameworks, CSS-in-JS, and pre & post processors they’re aware of and how satisfied they are with them.</p>
          <p>When a browser first connects to a particular server, i.e. sends a get request, to a particular server, the browser responds with a post request and a cookie, more specifically a Set-Cookie header.</p>
<img src="" class="blog-entry-image" alt="">
          <p>The most telling, in my eyes, graphical representation of those results is the following table in which they plotted satisfaction with frameworks etc. against user numbers.</p>
<img src="" class="blog-entry-image" alt="">
<p>It turns out that Bootstrap - which I have been using frequently and which I have learned about extensively during my full-stack web development course - only has a satisfaction rate of just 52%. Contrastingly, a framework called "Tailwind" has an 81% satisfaction score! "Bulma" has 74%. Tailwind and Bulma, admittedly, have much less users though. And since Bootstrap is the industry standard, it might just be that people who actually make the effort to read into and learn a non-industry standard like Tailwind then also are naturally more satisfied with it. And given that Bootstrap is the industry standard, and much more people use it, it makes sense that satisfaction rates are lower. (That said, I would have expected a slightly higher Bootstrap satisfaction score.)</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this has prompted me to look into the the CSS frameworks Tailwind and Bulma, both of which I write about in separate blog articles.</p>
